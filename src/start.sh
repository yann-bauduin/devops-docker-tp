# 'e' option will cause the shell to exit if any invoked command fails.
# 'u' option treats unset variables and parameters as an error.

touch /tmp/started.time
# This command creates a file named 'started.time' in the '/tmp' directory.
# If the file already exists, the command does not change the file but updates its access and modification timestamps.

# This conditional statement checks the exit status of the last command (touch command in this case).
# If the exit status is not zero, which indicates an error, the script will exit immediately.

date > /tmp/started.time
# This command writes the current date and time to the 'started.time' file.
# The '>' operator is used to redirect the output of the 'date' command to the file.

# It's used to pass control from the script to another program or command.
