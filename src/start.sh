# Setting shell options for better error handling and debugging.

# 'u' option treats unset variables and parameters as an error.
# 'x' option prints each command that gets executed to the terminal, useful for debugging.

touch /home/www/started.time
# This command creates a file named 'started.time' in the '/home/www' directory.
# If the file already exists, the command does not change the file but updates its access and modification timestamps.

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit
fi
# This conditional statement checks the exit status of the last command (touch command in this case).
# If the exit status is not zero, which indicates an error, the script will exit immediately.

date > /home/www/started.time
# This command writes the current date and time to the 'started.time' file.
# The '>' operator is used to redirect the output of the 'date' command to the file.

# This command replaces the current shell process with the command given as argument.
# It's used to pass control from the script to another program or command.
# The "$@" is a special variable that holds all the arguments passed to the script.
